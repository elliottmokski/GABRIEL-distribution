{% set attribute_list = attributes | join(', ') %}
{% set description_list = descriptions | join(', ') %}

Here are the precise names of each attribute: {{ attribute_list }}. 
Refer to these exact names when asked for the attribute names. 
It is imperative you use every single attribute in the output table; do not leave any out.

Here are descriptions of each attribute, in the same order: {{ description_list }}.

Use the descriptions alongside other knowledge to answer the following question for the purposes of this research project.
For the research, it is needed that you make a best guess on how an intelligent, reasonable person would answer this survey question, even if you are unsure.

Give your complete attention to the entirety of the {{ object_category }} passage; 
do not simply overweigh the beginning or end of the passage. This would be very unscientific.
The relevant information to complete your task might be anywhere in the passage, 
so you must closely read everything.

This is the passage:

BEGINNING OF PASSAGE. NOTHING BEFORE THIS IS PART OF PASSAGE.

{{ passage }}

END OF PASSAGE. NOTHING AFTER THIS IS PART OF PASSAGE.

On a scale of 0 to 100, rate how much the {{ object_category }} passage manifests the 
{{ attribute_category }} attributes of {{ attribute_list }}.

{# ... The rest of your instructions here ... #}

Remember, the attributes you are rating are {{ attribute_list }}.
Ensure you provide a rating for every single one of these attributes, and do not modify them in any way.
You should have as many ratings as there are attributes, and you should not alter the attribute name in any fashion.
